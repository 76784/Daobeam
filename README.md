# Daobeam - A low contrast, light theme, with balanced colors to minimize eye strain

## Philosophy
Have you ever watched television in a totally dark room? That is an example of high contrast. It is hard on your eyes. It leads to eye strain. It is unhealthy.

People like dark themes with bright foreground colors because they are eye-catching in the showroom. But most of these dark themes are very high contrast (example: Monokai). You're asking for eye strain by using themes like these. As a professional coder, I would not use a high contrast theme.

There are relatively few low contrast themes in general. They are much harder to design, and to design well. So I decided to design one myself.

**Daobeam** is designed to be low contrast and balanced in it's coloring. 

The Firefox (desktop) reader button (sepia setting) uses a similar (but lighter) beige background as **Daobeam**. **_Beige as a background is a thing, and a thing that works well._** If you want to look cool to your peers, use Monokai. If you want a theme that will minimize eye strain and help you code all day, use **Daobeam**.

## My Approach / Things to Notice About **Daobeam**
Use colors that compliment each other. Don't use a bullhorn when designing. Syntax highlighting is supposed to help you code, not scream at you.

Colors balanced using professional tools, to ensure they compliment each other. For example, #880000 (burgundy) and #000088 (purple) [are tetradic harmonized colors][0].

Use bold when something is more powerful than something else. Case in point: CSS element names are in bold, because targeting them in CSS is more powerful than targeting an id or a class name. At the same time, don't get overly granular and try to highlight ids differently than class names.

In my CSS screenshots, notice how the property values are all the same color (good!). In many of the themes you see, this is not the case. As a long-time CSS developer, I want all property values to be the same color. Most themes don't have this consistency because the theme author didn't put in the time to figure out how to do it. I did.

## Recommendations
DejaVu Sans Mono for a coding font.

Do View / Reset Zoom. I use a font-size of 18px on a 1920x1200 monitor. Use alt + Z to word wrap - I wish that were the VS Code default.
